# Riddle Writing Guide

## Core Philosophy
Riddles should be intellectually challenging puzzles that reward deep knowledge of Joy's interests. Layer complexity and obscure references to create satisfying "aha!" moments when connections click.

## The Golden Rules

### DO's ✅

1. **Layer Multiple References**
   - Surface level: Misdirection or abstract concept
   - Middle level: Obscure reference to Joy's interests
   - Deep level: Technical knowledge or deep lore
   - Hidden level: Wordplay or double meanings

2. **Embrace Complexity**
   - Use technical terminology she knows (music theory, game mechanics)
   - Reference deep lore (Ōkami mythology, Arcane world-building)
   - Require connecting multiple concepts
   - Make her work for the solution

3. **Escalate Difficulty Aggressively**
   - Start medium to establish this is a real challenge
   - Peak at near-frustration in middle
   - Maintain high difficulty throughout
   - Only ease up if she's genuinely stuck

4. **Hide References in Layers**
   - Bury the actual clue in metaphor
   - Use obscure quotes or paraphrases
   - Reference minor details from her interests
   - Require encyclopedic knowledge to solve

### DON'T's ❌

1. **Don't Be Vague Without Purpose**
   - Bad: "Where things are kept"
   - Good: "Where silver sleeps in velvet darkness"

2. **Don't Make It Google-able**
   - Avoid generic riddles found online
   - Make it specific to your space and relationship

3. **Don't Forget the Physical Reality**
   - Consider apartment layout
   - Avoid sending her back and forth
   - Don't hide in inconvenient spots (under heavy furniture)

4. **Don't Make It Too Easy**
   - If she solves it immediately, you failed
   - Each riddle should require real thought
   - Embrace the struggle - it makes victory sweeter
