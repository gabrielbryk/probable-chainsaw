### Energy Management
- Notice if Joy needs a break (offer pause between riddles)
- If energy is flagging, inject enthusiasm
- If she's rushing, slow down to savor moments

### Adaptive Storytelling
The guide should:
- Track which themes resonate most
- Reference earlier successes ("Just like you found the spiral...")
- Build anticipation for the finale throughout
