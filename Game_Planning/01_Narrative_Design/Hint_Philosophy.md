# Hint Philosophy

## Core Principle

**Hints exist to preserve joy, not to avoid challenge.**

The goal is to keep Joy in the "flow state"—challenged enough to be engaged, supported enough to avoid frustration. The hint system should feel like a thoughtful companion, not a game master checking answers.

## The Four-Tier Hint Ladder

### Tier 1: Gentle Nudge (Thematic/Conceptual)
**When to Offer**: After 90-120 seconds of no progress

**Purpose**: Redirect attention without giving away the answer

**Characteristics**:
- Broadest possible hint
- Focuses on theme or category
- Encourages lateral thinking
- Preserves the "aha!" moment

**Example Formulations**:
- "Consider the [theme] that has always drawn you..."
- "Think about what in this space represents [interest area]..."
- "Your instincts about [general category] are worth trusting..."

**Specific Examples by Riddle**:
- **Riddle 1 (Spiral)**: "Think about the visual art that catches your eye daily in your apartment—something dark, surreal, and spiraling..."
- **Riddle 3 (Crystals)**: "Consider the treasures from deep in the earth that you've collected and displayed..."
- **Riddle 4 (Flute)**: "Think about the instrument that lets you create music, and the innovations that made it possible..."

---

### Tier 2: Directional Hint (Area/Domain)
**When to Offer**: After another 90-120 seconds, or if Tier 1 didn't help

**Purpose**: Narrow the field significantly while still requiring insight

**Characteristics**:
- Points to specific location category or knowledge domain
- Eliminates wrong paths
- Still requires connection-making
- Feels like collaborative problem-solving

**Example Formulations**:
- "The answer lies with [specific category of object]..."
- "Think about [specific author/artist/concept] and where you'd find them..."
- "Consider [specific knowledge area] and how it relates to [physical location]..."

**Specific Examples by Riddle**:
- **Riddle 1 (Spiral)**: "The answer is behind the Japanese horror artwork on your wall—where spirals and madness converge..."
- **Riddle 2 (Poetry)**: "Look to the poet who wrote about Little Dog and letters his mother couldn't read..."
- **Riddle 6 (Wavelength)**: "Think about Wolfgang Warsch's game about alignment and telepathy..."

---

### Tier 3: Direct Pointer (Specific Location/Answer)
**When to Offer**: After another 90-120 seconds, or if Joy expresses frustration

**Purpose**: Remove all ambiguity, point directly to solution

**Characteristics**:
- Names the specific location or answer
- Leaves only the final step (physical action or confirmation)
- Preserves dignity (frames as "here's what I was getting at")
- Moves forward without dwelling on difficulty

**Example Formulations**:
- "The next clue is [specific location]..."
- "You're looking for [specific object/person/concept]..."
- "Check [exact physical location]..."

**Specific Examples by Riddle**:
- **Riddle 1 (Spiral)**: "Look behind the Junji Ito Uzumaki tapestry hanging on your wall."
- **Riddle 3 (Crystals)**: "Check under your Larimar, Opal, or Smoky Quartz in your crystal collection."
- **Riddle 4 (Flute)**: "The answer is inside your flute case—the inventor Theobald Boehm."

---

### Tier 4: Solution Reveal (Skip Option)
**When to Offer**: After 5-6 minutes total on one riddle, or if Joy opts out

**Purpose**: Keep momentum, prevent abandonment of entire experience

**Characteristics**:
- Provides complete answer and location
- Reframes as "let's move on together"
- Doesn't dwell on the struggle
- Emphasizes that the journey matters more than perfect solutions

**Example Formulations**:
- "This one was extra tricky—the answer is [solution]. Let me show you where to go next..."
- "Here's what I was going for: [solution]. The next clue is [location]. Ready to continue?"
- "No worries at all—the answer is [solution]. Let's keep the adventure going..."

**Specific Examples by Riddle**:
- **Riddle 1 (Spiral)**: "The answer is the Junji Ito tapestry—there's an envelope taped to the back. Let's see what it says!"
- **Riddle 3 (Crystals)**: "The clue is hidden under one of your special crystals—the Larimar specifically. Check there and let's continue."

## Timing Guidelines

### Standard Progression
1. Joy starts riddle (timer begins)
2. **90-120 seconds**: Check in with Tier 1 hint (gentle)
3. **3-4 minutes total**: Offer Tier 2 hint (directional)
4. **4.5-5 minutes total**: Provide Tier 3 hint (direct)
5. **6+ minutes total**: Offer Tier 4 (solution/skip)

### Adaptive Timing
**Accelerate hints if**:
- Joy explicitly expresses frustration
- Energy is flagging (risk of disengagement)
- She's attempted multiple wrong answers
- Previous riddles took a long time

**Slow down hints if**:
- Joy is actively engaged and working through ideas
- She asks for more time
- She's making progress between hint offers
- Previous riddles were quick solves (confidence is high)

---

## Tone and Delivery

### Emotional Calibration

**If Joy is confident and cruising**:
- Hints can be more playful/cryptic
- Emphasize how clever she is
- Build excitement for next challenge

**If Joy is moderately stuck**:
- Supportive, collaborative tone
- "Let's figure this out together"
- Normalize the challenge

**If Joy is frustrated**:
- Immediate reassurance
- Skip formality, get to helpful information
- Reframe difficulty as designer's fault, not hers

### Language Patterns

**Always Include**:
- Validation ("This is a tough one" / "You're thinking in the right direction")
- Permission ("There's no rush" / "Take your time")
- Agency ("Would a hint help?" / "Want to keep trying or hear more?")

**Never Include**:
- Patronizing language ("Easy!" / "You can do it, buddy!")
- Pressure ("Time is running out" / "Almost there...")
- Judgment ("That's not right" / "Try again")

## Example Hint Progressions

### Riddle 2 - Ocean Vuong Poetry

**Tier 1 (Gentle - 90 sec)**:
> "Think about the contemporary poets whose words have moved you most deeply—the ones who write about vulnerability, translation, and love in two languages..."

**Tier 2 (Directional - 3 min)**:
> "The answer is in a book by an author who named himself after the sea. His epistolary novel about a son writing to his mother who can't read English..."

**Tier 3 (Direct - 4.5 min)**:
> "Check your Ocean Vuong poetry book—likely *On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous*. The next clue is tucked inside the pages."

**Tier 4 (Solution - 6 min)**:
> "The answer is Ocean Vuong! Your book is probably on the shelf or nightstand—look inside and you'll find the next clue waiting for you. Ready to continue?"

---

### Riddle 4 - Flute Music

**Tier 1 (Gentle - 90 sec)**:
> "Consider the instrument you've mastered, and the 19th-century German innovation that revolutionized its design and fingering system..."

**Tier 2 (Directional - 3 min)**:
> "Think about your flute and the inventor whose 1847 redesign created the modern Boehm system. Where would you find your instrument right now?"

**Tier 3 (Direct - 4.5 min)**:
> "The answer is Theobald Boehm, who invented the modern flute system. Check inside your flute case—that's where your next clue is hiding."

**Tier 4 (Solution - 6 min)**:
> "This one required some serious music history knowledge! The answer is Theobald Boehm. Open your flute case and the next clue is right there. Shall we continue?"

## Automatic vs. Manual Intervention

### Automatic Triggers (LLM decides)
- Time-based progression through tiers
- After multiple incorrect answer attempts
- If Joy types "hint" or "help" or similar

### Manual Intervention (Gabe's role)
- If Joy is clearly stuck but not asking for help (read the room)
- If technical issues arise (LLM not responding, etc.)
- If Joy wants to skip entire riddle
- If physical clue is actually missing/damaged

---

## Special Considerations

### First Riddle (Confidence Builder)
- More generous with hints
- Faster progression if needed
- Goal: early success to build momentum

### Final Riddles (Maintain Momentum)
- Don't let them drag on
- Hints can come faster
- Preserve energy for finale

### Optional Riddle 7
- Can be skipped entirely without hints
- If attempted and struggling, very fast hint progression
- "This one's optional—want to continue or skip ahead?"

---

## Wrong Answer Handling

### Partially Correct Answers
- Celebrate what's right
- Gently redirect
- "You're on the right track with [correct element], but think about [missing piece]..."

### Completely Wrong but Thoughtful
- Validate the thinking
- Don't embarrass
- "Interesting interpretation! But let me point you toward [correct domain]..."

### Random Guessing
- Gentle redirection to actual engagement
- "Let's slow down and look at the clue again together. What stands out to you?"

---

## Psychological Safety

**Remember**: The goal is Joy feeling celebrated, not tested.

**If in doubt**:
- Give the hint
- Err on the side of support
- Keep momentum going
- Save the challenge for the riddles, not the hint system
