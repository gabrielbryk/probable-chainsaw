Dearest Joy,

Today is not just your birthday—it's the beginning of an adventure crafted just for you.
This quest will take you through the layers of who you are,
celebrating all the beautiful complexities that make you, you.

Your first challenge awaits where infinity coils upon itself,
where the eye cannot escape its own obsession.

## Option 2: Quest Theme
```
My Dearest Joy,

On this special day, I've hidden pieces of my heart throughout our home.
Each one holds a riddle, a memory, a reflection of you.
Find them all, and discover what waits at journey's end.

Begin your quest where madness spirals into beauty,
where Junji Ito's visions twist reality.

Happy Birthday, beautiful.
Let's play.

Forever yours,
Gabe
