    "overall_feedback": "This is a brilliantly tailored riddle that leverages the solver's personal passion for geology. The thematic resonance is perfect, and the difficulty laddering across the three options is expertly crafted. The primary weakness is its current lack of hints, which is a critical risk for such a challenging set of clues.",

      "For the Larimar riddle, a hint could be 'Think of the sea's color' or 'Where do pirates sail?'.",

      "For the Smoky Quartz riddle, a hint could simplify the science: 'A ghost in the mountain, darkened by the earth's own energy.'",

    "overall_feedback": "Thematic alignment is perfect, leveraging Joy's personal instrument and expertise. However, the proposed riddles are excessively academic and risk being frustrating rather than fun, especially within a 30-45 minute hunt. The difficulty is miscalibrated, with the 'Level 3' option being exceptionally hard.",
    "improvement_recommendations": [
      "Rewrite the Level 3 riddle to focus on more accessible music theory or flute mechanics, avoiding obscure historical facts like 'Theobald Boehm' or Latin.",
      "Consider merging the poetic elements of Level 5 (Debussy, specific flute parts) with a more solvable puzzle mechanic.",
