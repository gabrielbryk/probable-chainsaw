## Phase 2: The Hunt Begins

### Starting the Experience

**When Joy Discovers Opening Letter**:
1. Give her space to read it alone (don't hover)
2. Watch her initial reaction (joy? confusion? excitement?)
3. Be ready to answer questions if she asks
4. Let her take the lead - this is her adventure

**If she asks "What is this?"**:
- "Read it and find out!"
- "It's your birthday adventure - the letter explains everything"
- Warm smile, encouraging tone

**If she seems hesitant**:
- "You can start whenever you're ready"
- "Want me to do it with you or would you rather explore alone?"
- No pressure, just invitation

---

### During the Hunt: Your Role

**Primary Job**: Supportive Observer

**Do:**
- Stay nearby but not hovering
- Watch for signs of frustration or joy
- Take photos/videos of discoveries
- Celebrate each success warmly
- Offer hints according to [[Hint_Philosophy]]
- Keep energy positive and encouraging

**Don't:**
- Solve riddles for her (unless she's truly stuck)
- Rush her through
- Hover over her shoulder
- Show disappointment if something goes wrong
- Get frustrated yourself

---

### Monitoring and Pacing

**Track Time Mentally** (not visibly)

**For Each Riddle**:
- 0-90 seconds: Let Joy work independently
- 90-180 seconds: Check if she wants a hint (Tier 1)
- 3-4 minutes: Offer Tier 2 hint proactively
- 4-5 minutes: Provide Tier 3 hint directly
- 6+ minutes: Offer Tier 4 (solution) or skip option

**Energy Level Checks**:

**If Joy is energized and flying through**:
- Match her enthusiasm
- Keep pace brisk
- Celebrate each win
- Consider adding complexity if she seems to want more challenge

**If Joy is engaged but measured**:
- Standard pacing
- Check in between riddles ("Want a quick break?")
- Continue as planned
- Enjoy the journey together

**If Joy seems tired or frustrated**:
- Accelerate hint delivery
- Offer breaks more frequently
- Consider skipping Riddle 7
- Remind her: "No pressure, we can take our time"
- Be ready to pivot to finale if needed

---

### Technical Operations

**LLM Guide Management**:
- Have Joy's device ready with interface open
- If system lags/fails: Switch to manual mode immediately
- You can deliver hints verbally if tech isn't working
- Don't troubleshoot for more than 60 seconds - use backup

**Smart Lighting Triggers**:
- Trigger effects manually if automated doesn't fire
- If lights fail: Skip effect, don't dwell on it
- "The lights were going to do something cool, but this is about you, not tech"

**Audio Cues**:
- Play celebration sounds at appropriate moments
- If not working: Skip it or make silly sound yourself
- Joy's joy > perfect effects

---

### Hint Delivery Guidelines

**Verbal Hint Format**:

**Tier 1 (Gentle)**:
- Casual, conversational tone
- "Hmm, think about [broad category]..."
- "Your instincts about [theme] are good..."
- **Example**: "Consider the visual art you're surrounded by daily..."

**Tier 2 (Directional)**:
- More specific, still collaborative
- "The answer is connected to [specific domain]..."
- "Think about where you'd find [specific type of object]..."
- **Example**: "This one's about the tapestry on your wall - the spirals..."

**Tier 3 (Direct)**:
- Clear pointer, removes ambiguity
- "Check [specific location]..."
- "The answer is [specific thing]..."
- **Example**: "Look behind the Junji Ito tapestry - there's something taped there"

**Tier 4 (Solution)**:
- Warm, encouraging, no dwelling
- "The answer is [solution]. Let's keep going!"
- "This one was extra tricky - it's [location]. Ready for the next?"
- **Example**: "It's the tapestry! Let me show you where exactly..."

**Tone Always**:
- Warm, never condescending
- Supportive, never impatient
- Celebratory, never critical
- Collaborative, never superior

---

### Managing Riddle-Specific Situations

**Riddle 1 (Confidence Builder)**:
- Should be relatively easy
- If she struggles: Quick hints, get her a win
- Goal: Build momentum and confidence

**Riddle 3 (Hardest - Crystals)**:
- Expect this to take longer
- Be generous with hints
- Validate effort: "This one's tough!"
- Don't let it drag past 7-8 minutes total

**Riddle 7 (Optional)**:
- Read the room - include only if energy is high
- If Joy seems tired: "We can skip this one and go to the finale"
- No shame in skipping

---

## Phase 3: The Finale

### Building to the Reveal

**After Final Riddle**:
- Let anticipation build briefly
- "One more step - you've done all this, now here's what it leads to..."
- Guide Joy to finale location
- Let her open/discover finale herself

**During Finale**:
- Give space for emotional reaction
- Have camera ready (but don't be intrusive)
- Be present for tears, laughter, whatever comes
- Read final message together or let her read alone (her choice)
- Present the gift/experience with love

**If Joy Gets Emotional** (happy tears):
- That's the goal - let her feel it
- Hug, comfort, reassure
- "You deserve this"
- "I wanted you to know how seen you are"
- Give time - don't rush to next thing

---

## Phase 4: Post-Hunt Celebration

### Immediate Aftermath

**Take Time Together**:
- Don't immediately jump to next activity
- Sit with the experience
- Let Joy process and share thoughts
- Ask: "What was your favorite part?"

**Documentation**:
- Take photos of Joy with finale gift
- Save riddle cards as keepsakes
- Video reactions (if appropriate)
- But don't let documentation overshadow experience

**Celebrate**:
- However Joy wants - meal, movie, quiet time, going out
- Follow her energy
- This is her day - she leads

## Energy Management (For You, Gabe)

### Self-Care During Hunt

**Stay Hydrated**: Have water nearby
**Stay Calm**: If something goes wrong, breathe
**Stay Present**: Don't think ahead to next riddle while she's solving current
**Stay Joyful**: Your energy affects her experience
**Stay Flexible**: Abandon plans that aren't working

**Remember**:
- Joy loves you for who you are, not for perfect execution
- Thoughtfulness is already evident in creating this
- She'll remember how she felt, not minor glitches
- You're doing something incredibly thoughtful
- Enjoy this - you worked hard to create it

---

## Celebration Mindset

**Throughout the Hunt**:
- This is about Joy feeling celebrated and loved
- Every riddle is a love letter
- Every hint is support, not failure
- The finale is the "thank you for existing"
- Imperfection is human and beautiful

**If Everything Goes Perfectly**: Wonderful!
**If Things Go Sideways**: Also wonderful - you're present and trying

**Success = Joy Feels Loved**

That's the only metric that matters.
