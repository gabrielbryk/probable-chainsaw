| - | **TOTAL** | - | - | - | **30-45 min** | **Finale** |

## Duration & Timing
- **Opening Letter**: 2-3 minutes to read invitation and set the tone.
- **Each Riddle Solve**: Aim for 3-5 minutes with Level 3 text, longer if using harder variants.
- **Travel Time**: 1-2 minutes to move between spaces without rushing.
- **Finale Reveal**: Reserve 5+ minutes for the emotional payoff and gift.
- **Overall Target**: 30-45 minutes for the full experience; adjust by adding/removing riddles or changing hint cadence.

## Physical Flow Principles
- Avoid backtracking so movement feels natural through the apartment.
- Alternate rooms or zones to create a sense of progression.
- Keep hiding spots accessible but still clever—nothing should require moving heavy objects.
- Secure placement so clues do not fall, get stuck, or cause damage.
- Consider safety (pets, candles, liquids) when choosing each location.
