# Veil of Steam – Bathroom Mirror Reveal Planner

## Snapshot
- **Narrative Anchor**: Mirrors + being seen (Narrative Bible theme). Joy triggers a hidden message that only appears when the bathroom mirror fogs up, turning a mundane ritual into an intimate revelation before the finale.
- **Mechanic**: Message is written on the mirror with dish soap (or specialist reveal pen). When Joy runs a hot shower for ~1 minute, condensation reveals the words plus a symbol leading to the hidden location or password.
- **Emotional Beat**: Late-middle vulnerability / anticipation before finale.
- **Difficulty Target**: ⭐⭐ (simple action, emotional payoff).

## Status Tracker
- [ ] Choose message text & symbol (e.g., "OPEN THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES")
- [ ] Draft riddle pointing Joy toward "summoning warmth" to see truth
- [ ] Test soap/marker method on mirror (multiple days in advance)
- [ ] Prep cleanup plan so residue isn’t obvious pre-hunt
- [ ] Decide follow-up clue placement (bathroom cabinet? final letter?)

## Riddle Structure Notes
1. **Clue Text**: Delivered via previous puzzle or Guide: "Some truths bloom only when the room remembers breath. Invite the mirror to fog, and read what was written long before tonight." 
2. **Hint Ladder**:
   - Gentle: "Consider where reflections gather." 
   - Directional: "Warmth + water + mirror." 
   - Direct: "Steam the bathroom mirror with the shower." 
   - Solution: "Turn on hot water for a minute—the words 'SHELF OF SPIRALS' will appear; look there next."
3. **Answer Handling**: Physical; optionally require typing revealed word into app to continue.

## Physical Setup Plan
- Clean mirror thoroughly; dry.
- Write message using clear dish soap + cotton swab or specialized condensation pen. Let dry fully so it’s invisible.
- Neatly arrange towels to encourage Joy to stay; maybe place tea light (battery) to maintain dark aesthetic.
- Stage small towel to wipe condensation afterward.
- Hide next clue (e.g., final letter) inside bathroom cabinet or under sink with spiral motif.

## Technical/Effect Integration Options
- Lighting Bridge triggers warm amber bathroom light + subtle audio cue when preceding riddle solved, nudging Joy toward bathroom.
- Optionally place NFC tag near mirror to log success when she taps phone after reading message.
- Frontend prompt: "When the mirror speaks, enter the word you read." Ensures Game Master knows she advanced.

## Materials & Tools
- Clear dish soap / invisible ink marker for condensation
- Cotton swabs or fine-tipped brush
- Microfiber cloth for cleanup after event
- Timer/phone to ensure hot water not left running too long
- Optional essential oil diffuser for aroma (aligns with spa vibe)

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Message legible after 45–60 seconds of steam
- [ ] No ghost image visible before steaming
- [ ] Water runoff doesn’t drip message onto counter
- [ ] Bathroom fan disabled/off during reveal
- [ ] Cleanup materials staged discreetly

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Water restrictions / waste** → Keep message short so steam time minimal; remind Joy to shut off quickly.
- **Room already humid (not revealing)** → Run small humidifier earlier to test; have backup card in cabinet repeating message just in case.
- **Joy notices residue beforehand** → Apply night before event; do final wipe to blend edges.

## Open Questions
1. Should the revealed message include coordinates to final gift or cue to optional bonus riddle?
2. Would adding a poetry line (Ocean Vuong quote) deepen the emotional impact?
3. Can we layer a second message (mirror writing) requiring phone flashlight for extra puzzle depth, or would that feel busy?
