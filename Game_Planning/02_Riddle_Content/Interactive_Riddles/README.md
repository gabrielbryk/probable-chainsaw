# Interactive Riddle Planning Hub

Purpose: maintain a modular archive of high-effort mechanics so Gabe can mix and match puzzles once the final hunt lineup is chosen. Each subfolder contains the working planner for a single riddle, emphasizing setup and tech requirements per the latest brief.

## Riddle Index
| Riddle | Mechanic | Emotional Beat | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Celestial Étude – Piano](./Celestial_Etude_Piano/Plan.md) | Play chord progression detected via Web MIDI | Act 2 celebration / mastery | Drafted planner ✅
| [Siren's Resonance – Mic](./Siren_Melody_Mic/Plan.md) | Sing lyric into web mic for validation | Deep-middle vulnerability | Drafted planner ✅
| [Luminous Glyph – Glow](./Glow_Glyph_Message/Plan.md) | Charge glow-ink sigil, read in dark | Wonder interlude between geology + music | Drafted planner ✅
| [Veil of Steam – Mirror](./Steam_Sigil_Mirror/Plan.md) | Steam bathroom mirror to reveal message | Late-middle anticipation | Drafted planner ✅

## How to Use
1. Clone a planner when promoting the concept to "active"; add riddle ID + difficulty details in `02_Riddle_Content/Riddle_Flow_Map.md` once locked.
2. Each planner tracks narrative copy, physical prep, technical tasks, materials, testing, risks, and open questions.
3. When a mechanic is confirmed, move deliverables (riddle text, hint ladder, accepted answers) into a dedicated `Riddle_Text.md` alongside the planner, keeping the plan as the setup source of truth.
4. Update `docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` Phase 1.2 checkboxes as riddles graduate from planning to finalized content.

## Next Steps
- Decide which of these interactive mechanics make the final seven-core lineup vs. optional inserts.
- Create planners for any remaining "potential" riddles so we stop tracking requirements ad hoc.
- Once selections are made, integrate chosen planners into `Riddle_Flow_Map.md` + `Crafting_Plan.md` so physical production stays accurate.
