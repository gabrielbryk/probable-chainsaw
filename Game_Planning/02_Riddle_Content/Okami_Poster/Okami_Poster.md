## Riddle Options

### Level 3: Deep Lore (⭐⭐⭐)
"Where the thirteenth technique meets Yami's core, behind Issun's prophecy fulfilled at the summit of Ark of Yamato."
(Requires knowing all 13 Celestial Brush techniques, final boss location)

### Level 4: Japanese Mythology & Game Mechanics (⭐⭐⭐⭐)
"At the convergence of 天照大神 and Shiranui's 100-year cycle, where Power Slash 3 requires 60,000 Yen and Golden Fury costs 100,000 praise—calculate the wolf's true name."
(Amaterasu Ōmikami in Japanese, specific upgrade costs)

### Level 5: Multi-Layer Cipher (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
"[(Susano's 8 sake barrels × Orochi's heads) + Waka's true form moon tribe years] ÷ Ninetails's tube foxes = X. At the Xth Celestial Brush god, find where lupine divinity meets canvas."
(Complex calculation: (8×8 + 200) ÷ 9 = 29.3... leads to thinking about brush gods)
