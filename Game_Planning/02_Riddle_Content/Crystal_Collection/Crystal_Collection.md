## Riddle Options

### Level 3: Geological Deep Cut (⭐⭐⭐)
"In the pectolite that remembers Bahoruco's volcanic tears, where copper traces paint the Caribbean sky in stone—find the extinct mine's only child."
(Larimar - requires knowing it's blue pectolite, only from Dominican Republic)

### Level 4: Chemistry & Mythology (⭐⭐⭐⭐)
"SiO₂·nH₂O imprisoned at 6.5 Mohs, where Andamooka meets Coober Pedy in hydrated silence, drowning to preserve its play-of-color from the Cretaceous sea."
(Opal - chemical formula, hardness scale, Australian mining towns)

### Level 5: Multi-Science Cipher (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
"At 2.65 specific gravity, where aluminum replacing silicon creates the phantom of Cairngorm, seek the macrocrystalline α-quartz variant darkened by natural γ-radiation at >50 Gy."
(Smoky quartz - requires knowledge of density, Scottish Cairngorm variety, radiation physics)
