## Difficulty Rating System

### ⭐⭐⭐ (Accessible Challenge)
**Characteristics**:
- Requires specific knowledge Joy definitely has
- One or two logical leaps
- Clear thematic connection
- Can be solved in 2-4 minutes with focus

**Example**:
> "Where Little Dog writes to his mother who cannot read, between Hartford and Saigon, in the book that bleeds at 28."

**Why it's ⭐⭐⭐**: Requires knowing Ocean Vuong and "On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous," but Joy has read this and it's personally meaningful.

---

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Challenging)
**Characteristics**:
- Multi-domain knowledge required
- Several logical steps
- May include technical/specialized terminology
- Likely to need 4-6 minutes or a hint

**Example**:
> "Where 262 Hz becomes 524 Hz through overblowing at the pressure antinode, Syrinx's transformation awaits at 0.483 times the wavelength from the embouchure."

**Why it's ⭐⭐⭐⭐**: Requires music theory (harmonic series), physics (acoustics), mythology (Pan/Syrinx), and knowledge of flute mechanics.

---

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Very Challenging)
**Characteristics**:
- Highly specialized multi-domain knowledge
- Abstract or cipher-like presentation
- May include foreign language
- Designed to feel impressive to solve
- Expected to require hints for most people
