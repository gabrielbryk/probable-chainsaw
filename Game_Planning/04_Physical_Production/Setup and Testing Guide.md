# Physical Setup Guide

## Purpose
Lock in the physical side of the hunt—locations, materials, and flow—before running the full rehearsal outlined in [[05_Testing_and_Execution/Full_Run_Test_Plan]].

## Pre-Setup Walkthrough
- Walk the entire path in order to confirm there is no awkward backtracking.
- Check sight lines and ensure Joy’s natural movement reveals each clue without making anything obvious.
- Validate every hiding spot: secure enough to stay put, accessible without force, and safe for furniture or pets.
- Read each printed riddle in place to confirm the clue makes sense relative to its surroundings.

## Placement Best Practices
- Favor placing items inside or attached to sturdy surfaces rather than balancing them loosely.
- Protect envelopes from moisture, pets, or drafts using tape, clips, or small containers.
- Use subtle visual nudges (stickers, partial reveals, themed decorations) only when a location proves too hidden.
- Keep props consistent with the surrounding aesthetic so clues feel intentional.

## Flow & Documentation
- Number each envelope on the back (for you) and keep a simple master list with locations plus backup hints.
- Take quick photos of every placement so you can recreate the setup after testing.
- Maintain a “reset kit” with extra envelopes, tape, and pens for last-minute fixes.

## Quick Spot-Check (Before Full Test)
- Confirm physical clues are still in place after a short walk-through.
- Verify each clue transitions cleanly to the next location described in [[Riddle_Flow_Map]].
- Trigger any special effects manually to ensure hardware still responds.
- If anything feels uncertain, note it here and address it during the formal run in [[05_Testing_and_Execution/Full_Run_Test_Plan]].

## Day-Of Readiness
- Use [[05_Testing_and_Execution/Day-Of Checklist]] for the full morning routine.
- Lean on [[05_Testing_and_Execution/Backup Hints and Help]] and [[04_Physical_Production/Contingency Plans]] if something shifts mid-hunt.
- Keep charged devices and spare materials nearby so you can respond quickly without breaking immersion.
