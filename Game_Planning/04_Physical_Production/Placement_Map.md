# Placement Map

## Apartment Layout & Route Planning

This document provides spatial guidance for hiding clues in a logical, accessible sequence that creates a natural flow through the apartment.

---

## General Principles

### Spatial Flow
- **Avoid excessive backtracking**: Each clue should lead forward through space
- **Balance room distribution**: Don't cluster all clues in one area
- **Accessibility**: All hiding spots should be Joy's normal height/reach
- **Visibility**: Hidden but discoverable (not impossibly obscure)
- **Safety**: No climbing, reaching over hazards, or unstable locations

### Hiding Spot Criteria
- **Stable**: Won't fall, shift, or blow away
- **Safe**: No sharp edges, heat sources, or breakable items nearby
- **Accessible**: Joy can reach without assistance
- **Discoverable**: Once Joy knows where to look, finding it is straightforward
- **Protected**: Clue won't get damaged by moisture, heat, pets, etc.

## Riddle-by-Riddle Placement

### Starting Point: Opening Letter

**Options** (Choose based on Joy's morning routine):
1. **On pillow** - First thing she sees when waking
2. **Coffee maker** - Discovers when making morning coffee
3. **Bathroom mirror** - Taped to mirror she uses daily
4. **Kitchen table** - At her breakfast spot
5. **Laptop** - On top of closed laptop

**Recommendation**: Choose a location that feels special but natural to her routine

**Setup**:
- Envelope propped or lightly taped
- Visible but elegant
- No chance of getting lost or knocked down

- Will discovering it feel satisfying (not fumbling)?

**Safety Notes**:
